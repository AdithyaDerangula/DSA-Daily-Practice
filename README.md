# DSA Daily Practice 🚀

Welcome to the **DSA Daily Practice Group Repo**!  
Solve **3–5 problems every day**, share your approaches, and track your streaks. Consistency > intensity. 💪

## How it works
- A new problem is added under `Problems/Day-XX/Problem.md`.
- Add your solution inside `Solutions/YourName/Day-XX/`.  
- Discuss time/space complexity in comments at the top of your file.  
- Update your streak in **Progress-Tracker.md**.

## Quick start
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Create a folder for the current day.
3. Add your solution inside the `Yourname/` subfolder.
4. Push and open a Pull Request if collaborating.


## Daily routine
- ⏱️ Set a 30–45 min timer per problem.
- ✍️ Write brute force → optimize → analyze complexity.
- 🔁 Review other solutions and leave comments.
