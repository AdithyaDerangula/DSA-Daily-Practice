# Day 01 â€” Two Sum (Easy)

**Task:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.  
Assume exactly one solution and that you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

**Follow-ups:**
- Can you solve it in `O(n)` time?
- What are the trade-offs between hash map vs brute force?

Add your solutions in `solutions/YourName.ext` and include complexity analysis.
